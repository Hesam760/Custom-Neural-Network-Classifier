# Custom-Neural-Network-Classifier
custom neural network classifier designed for fine-grained flower classification. The model was initially trained on Dataset A, and subsequently, the last layer was unfrozen for further training with Dataset B. The process involved freezing all layers except the last, followed by a subsequent training iteration where only the last layer was frozen, excluding the first 80 classes trained on Dataset A. This unique approach allowed for efficient integration of 20 additional classes from Dataset B into the existing model, resulting in a versatile classifier capable of distinguishing between 80 classes from Dataset A and 20 classes from Dataset B.
